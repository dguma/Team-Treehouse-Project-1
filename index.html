        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>I found my interest in technology at an early age when there was only AOL
          and Windows ME. During that time instant messaging was still very new to the world.
          At the age of 12, I was fond of taking compters apart and figuring out how they worked.
          In 2013 I went to college to figure out what field I was most interested in to start a career.
          After almost 2 years in I found that coding was something I felt I can prosper in. As of today,
          I have studied on my own with the help of Team Treehouse and books to create responsive
          websites and continue the coding journey.

        <h2>Ambitions</h2>
        <p>I aspire to create responsive web platforms for business clients and users to use.
          I wish to be able to acquire the skills needed to create new jobs that allow people
          to be able to work from their phone or any portable device.</p>
